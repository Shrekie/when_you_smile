# when_you_smile

<i>Generates a when you smile meme video</i>

Video generation is handled on the client, this includes the image layering, video effects and video encoding.
Resulting in a website that edits and renders a video directly on the client browser.

This is mostly possible because of this awesome library: https://github.com/brianchirls/Seriously.js

Website does allow the video to be uploaded to Facebook or downloaded.
